# Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs are unique assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold like any other piece of property, but they have no tangible form of their own. 
The digital tokens can be said to be like certificates of ownership for physical or virtual assets. NFTs are digital assets that run on blockchain. 
The value of NFTs largely stems from the idea of scarcity. Collectors of NFTs can own unique digital assets like art, sports highlights, or songs 
which can be bought and sold on marketplaces.
